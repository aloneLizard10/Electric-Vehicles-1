			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Electric vehicles, or EVs, are cars, trucks, and other vehicles that run on electricity rather than gasoline or diesel. They use rechargeable batteries to power an electric motor that drives the vehicle's wheels, instead of an internal combustion engine. EVs are considered more environmentally friendly than traditional vehicles because they produce zero emissions at the tailpipe, reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, EVs offer other benefits such as lower operating costs, reduced noise pollution, and a smoother, quieter ride. As technology has improved, the driving range of EVs has increased, making them a viable option for many drivers.</p>
			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>Electric vehicles (EVs) have been around for over a century, but they only recently gained mainstream popularity. Here is a brief history of EVs:</p>
			<li>Early 1800s: The concept of electric vehicles was first introduced in the early 19th century. The first electric vehicle was built by Thomas Davenport, an American blacksmith, in 1837.</li>
			<li>Late 1800s to early 1900s: Electric vehicles gained popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to their low noise, low maintenance, and ease of use. In fact, electric vehicles were more popular than gasoline-powered cars at the time.</li>
			<li>In 1910s to 1920s: The introduction of the assembly line by Henry Ford and the decrease in the price of gasoline led to the decline of electric vehicles.</li>
			<li>In 1970s to 1990s: Due to the oil crisis and environmental concerns, interest in electric vehicles reemerged in the 1970s. Electric vehicles were largely experimental during this time, with limited commercial success.</li>
			<li>Late 1990s to early 2000s: The introduction of the Toyota Prius, a hybrid electric vehicle, in 1997 marked a turning point for electric vehicles. In 2003, Tesla Motors was founded, and their first electric car, the Tesla Roadster, was introduced in 2008.</li>
			<li>2010s to present: In recent years, electric vehicles have become more popular due to advancements in technology, government incentives, and environmental concerns. Many major automakers, including General Motors, Ford, and Volkswagen, have announced plans to electrify their fleets.</li>
			<p>Overall, the history of electric vehicles has been one of ups and downs, with periods of popularity followed by decline. However, with increasing concerns about climate change and the need to reduce emissions, electric vehicles are likely to become even more important in the coming years.</p>

			<h2>Types of Electric Vehicles</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><h3><strong>Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):</strong></h3> Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are a type of electric vehicle that runs entirely on battery power. They use rechargeable batteries, typically lithium-ion, to power an electric motor that drives the vehicle's wheels. BEVs do not have a traditional gasoline engine, so they emit no tailpipe emissions, making them an environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional vehicles.To charge the battery, BEVs can be plugged into an electrical outlet or charging station, with the charging time depending on the size of the battery and the charging method. The range of BEVs can vary, with some models offering over 300 miles of range on a single charge. However, range anxiety, or the fear of running out of battery while driving, is still a concern for some consumers.Despite this, BEVs are becoming increasingly popular, and many automakers have plans to introduce more electric models in the coming years. BEVs offer a smooth, quiet ride, lower operating costs compared to traditional vehicles, and contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
				
				<div style="text-align:center;">
					<img src="bev.jpg" alt="types">
				</div>
				<h4>Main components of BEVs :</h4> <p>Electric motor, Inverter, Battery, Control Module, Drive train</p>
                <h4>Working principle of BEVs :</h4> <p>The power for the electric motor is converted from the DC Battery to AC. As the accelerator is pressed, a signal is sent to the controller. The controller adjusts the speed of the vehicle by changing the frequency of the AC power from the inverter to the motor. The motor then connects and leads to the turning of wheels through a cog. If the brakes are pressed, or the electric car is decelerating, the motor becomes an alternator and produces power, which is sent back to the battery.</p>
				<h4>Examples of BEVs :</h4> <p>MG ZS, TATA Nexon, TATA Tigor, Mahindra E20 plus, Hyundai Kona, Mahindra Verito </p>
				<img src="mgzs.jpg" alt="BEVs">

				<li><h3><strong>Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs):</strong></h3> Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) are a type of vehicle that combines a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) with an electric motor and battery system to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. HEVs operate by switching between the gasoline-powered engine and the electric motor, or using both simultaneously, depending on driving conditions and power demands.In most HEVs, the battery is charged through regenerative braking and by the gasoline engine while it's running, and the electric motor assists the gasoline engine during acceleration and cruising. HEVs can also use the electric motor exclusively for short distances, reducing emissions in urban environments.HEVs are typically more fuel-efficient than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles and produce lower emissions. They also tend to have better acceleration and can improve overall driving performance. However, they can be more expensive to purchase than traditional vehicles due to the added complexity of the hybrid system.</li>
				
				<div style="text-align:center;">
					<img src="hev.jpg" alt="types">
				</div>
				<h4>Main components of HEVs :</h4><p>Engine, Electric motor, Battery pack with controller & inverter, Fuel tank, Control module</p>
				<h4>Working principle of HEVs :</h4><p>The fuel tank supplies energy to the engine like a regular car. The batteries run on an electric motor. Both the engine and electric motor can turn the transmission at the same time. </p>
				<h4>Examples of HEVs :</h4><p>Engine, Electric motor, Battery pack with controller & inverter, Fuel tank, Control module </p>

                <li><h3><strong>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):</strong></h3>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are a type of hybrid electric vehicle that can be charged from an external power source, typically an electric outlet. PHEVs have both a gasoline engine and an electric motor, and can operate in all-electric mode for a limited range, typically between 20-40 miles depending on the model, before switching to the gasoline engine.PHEVs can be charged through regenerative braking, by the gasoline engine, or by plugging into an external power source. The battery system is typically larger than that of a traditional hybrid, allowing for longer all-electric range and reducing emissions.PHEVs offer the benefits of a hybrid electric vehicle, such as increased fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, while also offering the ability to drive on electricity alone for a limited range. PHEVs can be a good option for those who have access to charging infrastructure, drive short distances on a regular basis, and occasionally need the longer range provided by the gasoline engine. However, they can be more expensive than traditional hybrids due to the larger battery system and added charging capabilities. PHEVs can run in at least 2 modes:All-electric Mode, in which the motor and battery provide all the car's energy & Hybrid Mode, in which both electricity and petrol/diesel are employed</li>
				
				<div style="text-align:center;">
					<img src="phev.jpg" alt="types">
				</div>
				<h4>Main components of PHEVs :</h4><p>Electric motor, Engine, Inverter, Battery, Fuel tank, Control module, Battery Charger (if onboard model) </p>
				<h4>Working principle of PHEVs :</h4><p>PHEVs start-up in all-electric mode and make use of electricity until their battery pack is depleted. Once the battery gets drained, the engine takes over, and the vehicle operates as a conventional, non-plug-in hybrid. PHEVs can be charged by plugging into an outside electric power source, engine, or regenerative braking. When brakes are applied, the electric motor acts as a generator, using the energy to charge the battery. The engine's power is supplemented by the electric motor; as a result, smaller engines can be used, increasing the car's fuel efficiency without compromising performance. </p>
				<h4>Examples of PHEVs :</h4><p>Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid, BMW 330e, Porsche Panamera S E-hybrid, Chevy Volt, Chrysler Pacifica, Ford C-Max Energi, Mercedes C350e, Mercedes S550e, Mercedes GLE550e, Mini Cooper SE Countryman, Ford Fusion Energi, Audi A3 E-Tron, BMW i8, BMW X5 xdrive40e, Fiat 500e, Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima, Volvo XC90 T8. </p>
				<img src="mc350e2.jpg" alt="PHEVs">

                <li><h3><strong>Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs):</strong></h3>Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) are a type of electric vehicle that use hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity to power an electric motor. FCEVs do not use a traditional gasoline engine and emit only water and heat as byproducts.The fuel cell system in an FCEV combines hydrogen with oxygen from the air to produce electricity, which is used to power the electric motor. The process of combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity is highly efficient and produces no harmful emissions.FCEVs typically have a longer range than battery electric vehicles and can be refueled in a matter of minutes, similar to a traditional gasoline vehicle. However, the infrastructure for refueling FCEVs is currently limited, with only a few hydrogen fueling stations available in some regions.FCEVs offer the benefits of electric vehicles, such as zero emissions and quiet operation, without the range limitations of battery electric vehicles. However, the high cost of fuel cell technology and limited refueling infrastructure currently make FCEVs less accessible and practical for most consumers.</li>
			
				<div style="text-align:center;">
					<img src="fcev.jpg" alt="types">
				</div>
				<h4>Main components of FCEVs :</h4><p>Electric motor, Fuel-cell stack, Hydrogen storage tank, battery with converter and controller </p>
				<h4>Working principle of FCEVs :</h4><p>The FCEV generates the electricity required to run this vehicle on the vehicle itself. </p>
				<h4>Examples of FCEVs :</h4><p>Toyota Mirai, Riversimple Rasa, Hyundai Tucson FCEV, Honda Clarity Fuel Cell, Hyundai Nexo. </p>

                <p>These are the four types of EVs present in the world.
                    There is also an extended part of EVs such as :
                </p>
                <li><h3><strong>Extended Range Electric Vehicles (EREVs):</strong></h3>Extended Range Electric Vehicles (EREVs) are a type of electric vehicle (EV) that uses both an electric motor and a gasoline engine to power the car. EREVs are similar to Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), but have a larger battery that allows them to drive longer distances on electric power alone. When the battery is depleted, an EREV can continue to drive using a gasoline engine that acts as a generator to charge the battery. This means that EREVs can offer the benefits of an all-electric vehicle, such as reduced emissions and improved fuel economy, while also providing the convenience and flexibility of a gasoline engine for longer trips. EREVs are starting to gain popularity as a way to reduce emissions in the transportation industry, particularly for drivers who need to travel longer distances on a regular basis.</li>

				<li><h3><strong>Electric Buses:</strong></h3> These are fully electric buses that run on a battery and electric motor. They are becoming increasingly popular in cities around the world as a way to reduce air pollution and improve public transportation.</li>
				<li><h3><strong>Electric Trucks:</strong></h3> These are fully electric trucks that use a battery and electric motor to power the vehicle. They are starting to gain popularity as a way to reduce emissions in the transportation industry.</li>

				<h3>Each type of electric vehicle has its own unique features and benefits. Ultimately, the choice of which type of EV to purchase will depend on your driving needs and personal preferences.</h3>
